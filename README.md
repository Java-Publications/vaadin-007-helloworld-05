# Backend meets Frontend: Create rules for UI testing with jUnit4
A good UI test includes screenshots to determine what the user actually did. So that innumerable tests do not fill up the system, screenshots should be created only in case of error. The test combination of "Backend meets Frontend" Vaadin and Selenium is therefore still extended by jUnit4 and its rules.


## How to start
To play with this you only have to start the main - method from the class  ```org.rapidpm.vaadin.helloworld.server.Main``` and 
go with your browser to the address: [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)

Ok, you got your first Vaadin "Hello World".
